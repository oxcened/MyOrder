## Demo

You can find a demo [here](https://myorderdemo-80b12.web.app/).

You may try out everything except for the `Submit to Google Sheets` feature located at `/summary`
because [it costs money](https://media.tenor.com/5Z-o3OKSPFIAAAAC/adult-swim-monkey.gif).

## Run on your machine

1. Use the right node version (`14.x`). I suggest using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

   If you have that you can just run:

    ```
    nvm use
    ```

1. Install dependencies

    ```
    npm run install
    ```

1. Setup environment

    1. This app is meant to work on top of a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project, so you should create your
       own.
    1. Initialize [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart).
    1. [Obtain the project config object](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/learn-more#config-object).
    1. Create an `.env.development` file in the root of the project.
    1. Place inside of it the config object, as a reference see `.env.example`.

1. Run the app
    ```
    npm run start
    ```

## Build for production

1. Use the right node version (`14.x`). I suggest using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

   If you have that you can just run:

    ```
    nvm use
    ```

1. Setup environment

   The same as the third step of [Run on your machine](#run-on-your-machine) applies, except the app will
   use `.env.production` this time. Learn
   more [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/local-development/environment-variables/).

1. Build the app
    ```
    npm run build
    ```

1. Serve the app
    ```
    npm run serve
    ```

   titled `fix: #[number of issue] [description of issue]`.

### Feature requests

1. If you have an idea to discuss with the community, feel free to open a discussion.
1. For feature requests, you are free to open a new issue.
1. All feature requests may not fit this project and will be subject to discussion!

### Testing

I suggest making sure all tests run successfully before submitting a PR (even though they are run anyway on GitHub).

To do so, run:

```
npm run test
```
